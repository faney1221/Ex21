this project implement a 2D pixel map system with drawing tools and pathfinding algoritem . features include flood ill, shortes path calculaton, and grapical visualization
project files- Index2d ,Map2D,ex_GUI all have teir metod i also explain insaide the code
key algorithms flood fill -fills conected region with new color using BFS
shorthest path -find the shortest path between two point using BFS avoiding obstacles
all distance- calculate distance from start  to all reacheble pixel
expectes- window open showing "100", file "map,txt" created , console " map saved sucssefuly"
resource stDraw ,BFS, Flood fill
